Simen implemented the Object Pooling pattern to make sure we arent creating unlimited bullets, but instead a pool of them.

Tamer implemented the Adapter pattern to modify the existing functionality of the objecting pooling pattern Simen created so we can shoot a pool of green lasers aswell.

Simen and Ryan applied the Factory Pattern to handle the different sizes of asteroids.
