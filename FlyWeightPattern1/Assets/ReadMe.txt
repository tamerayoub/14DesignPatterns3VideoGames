In this project,

Tamer Ayoub implemented two patterns, the Fly Weight Pattern and the Sandbox Pattern.


We implemented the fly weight pattern by making our disco lights more lighter on the processor using the scripts ColorChangerOld and ColorChanger.


We implemented the sandbox pattern to give our characters their own unique jumping ability w/ out having to worry about always making a
a new function for each character - these modifications are in the Jumping.cs, LowJump.cs , HighJump.cs and GameController.cs scripts.
